Rawr
====


The initial intent for the rawr-core repo was that Rawr (a JRuby packaging tool) would be split into parts, with key code going into rawr-core and other stuff going into rawr-more or rawr-whatever

But in reality people have only been working on Rawr.

So the Rawr code from Kenai has been moved over to GitHub, and resides under rawr/rawr.
